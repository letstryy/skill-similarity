How amazing is that?</p> <p><strong>We have an ICT vacancy based at our Head Office in Derby.</strong></p> <p>You will be assisting our ICT Manager with the ICT support for our users (desktop PCs, laptops, tablets, mobile phones) and some system administration (assisting with setting up profiles, computers &amp; the backup procedure). For the right candidate, the role  could in time develop into assisting with network &amp; server administration. This is a great opportunity for you to get stuck in on a practical level, in many areas of ICT in a business.</p> <p><strong>Alerter Group plc is a market leading technology company.</strong></p> <p>We design, manufacture, install &amp; maintain a range of innovative products. These are emergency and/or communication systems to be used in workplaces, Universities/Colleges or hotels for example.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s in it for you?</strong></p> <p>Your base salary will start at \u00a315,000-\u00a320,000 a year (depending on experience). We also only work office hours of 8:30-17:00, Monday to Friday (with an hour for lunch). We also provide a staff pension scheme and a childcare voucher scheme.</p> <p><strong>Do I need to be qualified/experienced in IT?</strong></p> <p>Experience is vital, but this position would suit someone looking for a junior role, with only 1 to 2 years of experience in some areas of IT, or someone with a bit more experience of servers, networks, desktops, help desk and mobile devices. Having IT qualifications  as well as experience would be an advantage.</p> <p><strong>What will your working environment be like?</strong></p> <p>You will work from our Head Office, which is a beautiful period building on the edge of Derby city centre (however, although a period building, we invest in the latest ICT infrastructure!). You will have your own desk in your own office adjoining the ICT  Manager\u2019s. So, you\u2019ll have your own space, but also advice and support will be close by.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the company culture like?</strong></p> <p>We\u2019re a friendly bunch of people who share similar goals. We all want to work hard and achieve something at work, but also make a difference in the World and earn money doing this! Our team are welcoming and good-natured.</p> <p><strong>Will my role really make a difference?</strong></p> <p>YES! We\u2019re still a relatively small company with about 40 members of staff (although hoping to be about 50 by the end of this year). The Managers and Directors really do take an interest in your work and notice when people make that extra bit of effort (there  are recognition schemes for this too).</p> <p><strong>Will I have fun too?</strong></p> <p>Yes, we like to have fun as a team too. We have staff social events at least 4 times a year (which the company pays for). In the past, this has included things like curry nights, ten pin bowling, laser quest, Christmas meals and a fun casino. They aren\u2019t  compulsory, but a great chance to socialise with people for all areas of the business.</p> <p><strong>What are the career prospects for this role?</strong></p> <p>We would be happy for someone to stay in this role, becoming an ICT specialist in this key area of the business. However, this type of role could be a stepping stone in your IT career.</p>             </div>"], "date": "2017-02-09"},
